# Simple and Responsive CV Template

This template layout is designed for someone (i.e me) who:
* Wants a single page CV
* Wants a clean layout with a lot of whitespace
* Works in tech
* Lists 2-3 past job experiences

But of course anyone can feel free to adapt and tweak to their needs!

This template is built to work nicely on both desktop and mobile screens using vanilla css and template is rendered using [alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) to keep it simple and small.
